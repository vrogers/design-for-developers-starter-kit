I want to create a personal website to show what I've worked on and what I'm available to work on. I want to show what I've done and things I'm excited to do. I want to show people and things I'm interested in and love.

## The key users.
*Describe behaviors, expectation, knowledge, or other characteristics. (One sentence each)*
Potential clients/partners will want to see what I've built and can build.
Family/Friends will want to see what I'm up to

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
*These should be short narratives of the above users with your app / site. (One sentence each)*

Collaborators click around and see what I've done and what I'm interested in
Family/Friends click around to see pictures of me and what I'm doing.
